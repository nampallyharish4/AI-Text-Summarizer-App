## üîß API Endpoints

### Netlify Functions

#### `/.netlify/functions/summarize`
Summarizes the provided text using AI.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "text": "Your long text content here..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "summary": "AI-generated summary...",
  "originalLength": 1500,
  "summaryLength": 200,
  "compressionRatio": 87,
  "mode": "ai"
}
```

#### `/.netlify/functions/health`
Health check endpoint for monitoring service status.

## üé® Customization

### Themes
The app supports both light and dark themes. You can customize the color schemes in `src/index.css` and `tailwind.config.js`.

### AI Model
You can change the AI model by updating the `HUGGINGFACE_API_URL` in `netlify/functions/summarize.js`. Popular alternatives include:
- `facebook/bart-large-cnn` (current, best for news articles)
- `google/pegasus-xsum` (good for general text)
- `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` (for conversational text)

### Text Limits
Adjust text limits in both frontend (`src/App.tsx`) and backend (`netlify/functions/summarize.js`):
- Minimum characters: Currently 200
- Maximum characters: Currently 100,000

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API key not configured" error:**
- Ensure your Hugging Face API key is set in Netlify environment variables
- Check that your API key is valid
- Redeploy the site after adding the environment variable

**"Model is loading" error:**
- Hugging Face models need to "warm up" on first use
- Wait 10-20 seconds and try again
- This only happens on the first request

**Demo mode instead of AI mode:**
- Check that `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` is properly set in Netlify environment variables
- Verify the API key is valid and has the correct permissions
- Check the Netlify function logs for any errors

## üìä Performance

- **Text Processing**: Handles up to 100,000 characters
- **Response Time**: Typically 3-10 seconds depending on text length
- **Accuracy**: Uses state-of-the-art BART model with high summarization quality
- **Rate Limits**: Respects Hugging Face API rate limits (free tier: 1000 requests/month)
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture scales automatically with demand
